    <h3>
        Ingredients:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups oat flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups oat milk or other plant milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the oat flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk, vinegar, maple syrup and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir with a large spoon until just combined, but do not over mix or the pancakes will be dense. A few lumps are okay. If it's really thick, add a little water and stir. Oat flour can soak up liquid as it sits, so you may need to add a little water as you go.</li>
        <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or a neutral flavored oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of batter on it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook for another minute or so, until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with maple syrup, vegan butter and fresh fruit.</li>    
    </ol>
